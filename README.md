- Task 2: Object Detection in Videos in VisDrone

## Trainig Data Anaylsis
The Traning data is same with 2018 version.

## Result Format

Both the ground truth annotations and the submission of results on test data have the same format for object detection in videos. That is, each text file stores the detection results of the corresponding video clip, with each line containing an object instance in the video frame. The format of each line is as follows:

```
<frame_index>,<target_id>,<bbox_left>,<bbox_top>,<bbox_width>,<bbox_height>,<score>,<object_category>,<truncation>,<occlusion>
```

Please find the example format of the submission of results for object detection in videos here (BaiduYun|Google Drive)
